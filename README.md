<h1 style="color:green;">Where I've worked🧑🏾‍💻</h1>	
#### **GenAI Product Manager Intern @ Delet, Los Angeles (_May'24 - Aug'24_)**
<div align="center">

  </a>
</div>
I probably had the most fun I've ever had building software during my 3 month internship at Delet. I led a team of 4 devs as a PM+Dev to launch a GenAI Leasing Agent feature for the Delet app. Read further about my experience <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shikharsingh167_product-productmanagement-pm-activity-7222910729174097920-PczX?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop" text="_bkank">here!</a>
<br><br>
#### **Associate Product Manager @ Wolters Kluwer, Chennai (_Jan'20 - Dec'22_)**

  </a>
</div>
I joined WK as a Product Analyst fresh out of college and eventually took up an APM role there for a SaaS product in the Legal Services domain. The 3 years I spent there were transformative to say the least. I worked on high-impact projects that generated millions for the organization and managed to develop strong professional relationships along the way 😁

#### **Data Science Intern @ Mphasis, Bengaluru (_May'19 - Jul'19_)**
<div align="center">
  <a href="https://www.mphasis.com/home/innovation/nextlabs.html" target="_blank">
<img src="assets/Mphasis_Logo.jpg"  class="green-border" alt="Mphasis" title="Mphasis" style="width:500px; height:200px; object-fit: cover;border-radius: 15px;"/>
  </a>
</div>
Mphasis was my first professional experience during my junior year of undergrad, and one I’m incredibly proud of. I learned new technology, worked with real-world datasets, and delivered impactful results. A highlight was presenting my project documentation to my manager and leaders, who were so impressed they showcased it to the entire team. I still keep two copies of my project report to this day—you can check it out <a href = "https://github.com/Shikhar167/Research-Projects-and-Awards/blob/master/Mphasis_Data_Science_Project/Mphasis_Internship.pdf" text="_blank">here!</a>

Remember all the times you missed a meeting and had to ask multiple people just to know what was decided?

LogDetect.AI is exactly that. <a href = "https://github.com/Shikhar167/LogDetect.AI" text="_blank">Check it out here!</a>

Scraped a bunch of data from the IPL 2024 cricket tournament, performed data cleaning and transformations and created a swanky Tableau dashboard that lets you pick the best XI based on your set criteria. Had a lot of fun working on this! <a href = "https://github.com/Shikhar167/USC/tree/main/IPL2024" text="_blank">Project Link!</a>
